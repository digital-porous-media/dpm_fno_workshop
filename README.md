#  2025 DPM IAP Workshop on Fourier Neural Operators

This hands-on workshop introduces Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) â€” a deep learning approach for approximating solution operators of partial differential equations. Participants will gain both theoretical background and practical experience implementing FNOs in PyTorch, with two example applications: time series prediction of mean curvature flow and steady-state pressure field approximation in Darcy flow. Hands-on portions may be run on Texas Advanced Computing Center clusters to accommodate computational demands.

_**Prerequisites**_: Working knowledge of Python, basic familiarity with neural networks and Pytorch, and a foundational understanding of PDEs. Some experience with working on remote clusters is recommended, but not required.
